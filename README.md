## Overview
This repository contains R scripts and an RMarkdown file used to analysis the mental health of Australians in the year of 2020. The data was pulled from the Australian Bureau of Statistic's General Social Survey: Summary Results dataset. The main purpose of this report was to compare male and female citizens with/without mental health issues, and their trust towards the healthcare system.

The final report can be viewed [here](https://github.com/ChristinaChanYing/Australian-Social-Determinants-of-Health/blob/main/outputs/paper/Mental_Health_Australia.pdf).


## File Structure
